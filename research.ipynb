    "- This study focuses only on software development aspects, out of score are e.g. end users and fair value of cryptocurrencies\n",
    "- Blockchain development popularity is in decline based on StackOverflow data\n",
    "- [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/evm) based blockchains dominating, as expected\n",
    "- Ethereum and [EVM-compatible blockchains](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/evm-compatible) cannot be differetiate, as they are more or less [clones](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/clone) \n",
    "  and do not offer unique selling points for a software developer\n",
    "- Solana is ~1/6th of EVM popularity, surprisingly high\n",
    "- Next runner ups are NEAR protocol and Bitcoin\n",
    "- We see two waves followed by cryptocurrency bull markets: 2018 and 2022. \n",
    "- The EVM development activity is still above the last bull market peak. Cryptocurrency development is less popular than it used to be,\n",
    "  but nowhere near dead yet.\n",
    "- Bitcoin development interest has not changed over a decade - not dead, but nothing happening\n",
    "- There are various alternative blockchain technologies that do not have taken off\n",
    "  in the development popularity over the years.\n",
    "- Private blockchains, Hyperledger, peaked 2018, in fact passed Ethereum, but \n",
    "  has been in decline ever since\n",
    "- We see some positive, and somewhat surprising results, like activation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is not fully representative, as it focuses on a single forum, StackOverflow, of which popularity has declined over the years. Futhermore, [the datasets end in May 2023](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360026). We assume StackOverflow stopped published datasets and is likely \n",
